      # If you are using <tt>attr_protected</tt> or <tt>attr_accessible</tt>,

      #
      # After any params are passed to the attributes writer they are available
      # via the attributes reader (they are stored in an instance variable of
      # the same name). The attributes reader returns nil if the attributes
      # writer has not been called.
      #
      # Supported options:
      # [:allow_destroy]
      # If true, destroys any members from the attributes hash with a
      # <tt>_delete</tt> key and a value that evaluates to +true+
      # (eg. 1, '1', true, or 'true'). This option is off by default.
      # [:reject_if]
      # Allows you to specify a Proc that checks whether a record should be
      # built for a certain attribute hash. The hash is passed to the Proc
      # and the Proc should return either +true+ or +false+. When no Proc
      # is specified a record will be built for all attribute hashes that
      # do not have a <tt>_delete</tt> that evaluates to true.
